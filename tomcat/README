This script will monitor a Tomcat server by parsing the Tomcat Manager
status page.  The script loops every 30 seconds.  The information it
prints are:

 * How much memory Tomcat is using versus how much it can use
 * For every listener, the number of worker threads that are not idle
   or in keepalive, versus the maximum number it can allocate
 * Number of requests in last 30 sec period, and average processing
   time for a request
 * Which URI are being served at the time

The script will save this information on daily "rolling" files, one for
status and one for URIs.
